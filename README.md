### `whoami`

A 3rd year uni student at Imperial College London.

<!-- 
Add a `pwd` section to actually address my present working conditions 
Update `help` to make it better
Maybe add a bit more to the `whoami`
Basically, write this up to be a nice README, and maybe add a redirect to my website? :)
-->

### `help`
Currently a work in progress, most of my contributions are in private repos for uni projects and whatnot.
Once I've made a bit of time for myself more projects will be added as I learn more and more languages, but for now, alas, I have nothing to show here.

### `history`

Studied GCSEs and A-levels without a formal Computer Science education.

However, did a 5-day python bootcamp a while back and realised that coding is super fun :D

Countless small python projects were spawned, but no major projects.\
(Although, maybe I'll dig up that adventure game and post it on here, sometime :0)

Then started attending uni, and... well... lost track of time.

### misc

Just wrote this because I like the idea of having a `README.md` for myself :)

All I'm really looking for is the time to spend on these projects, uni is really pushing it this year :/

Fun fact: pending, I'll think of a good one...

### \_\_future\_\_

Plan on redoing a couple of my uni projects, as well as writing a couple fun projects of my own, just to teach myself certain concepts and to build some fun things.
Perhaps also contribute to other projects, if any software bugs annoy me enough.
