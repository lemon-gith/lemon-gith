### `whoami`

A 4th year EIE (Electronic and Information Engineering) student at ICL (Imperial College London).

### `help`

Most contributions are in private repos or uni projects, some of which have now been made public since those modules are over, e.g. [HR PSP](https://github.com/lemon-gith/hr_psp-smart_contract), [bt_compress](https://github.com/lemon-gith/bt_compress).

Always looking to contribute to projects if I feel something could be done better or there are usability bugs, so I can be found in some forum discussions and small Pull Requests, too.

As I upload more projects and content, this section will adapt to providing help on navigating that.

### `history`

- hadn't studied CompSci before Uni
- 5-day Python bootcamp at 15
- wrote small Python projects/tools
  - calculators, algorithms, small utilities
  - a terminal rpg (might dig that up and upload it, sometime)
- learnt C++ in first year at Uni
- learnt to use Git over many projects
- learnt System Verilog in 2nd year for our ISAs module
- slowly learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript as I became more interested in websites
  - especially in how browsers work and web security
- started learning Rust out of interest in novel programming paradigms
- learnt F# as an intro into Functional Programming in 3rd year
  - which helped in my understanding of a lot of Rust concepts
- really learnt Javascript in my 3rd year internship
  - also where I picked up R and Fortran...
  - learnt more in-depth about Docker, RabbitMQ, and scalable solutions
- started using Typst for my project work and reports
- learnt Solidity in a Blockchain module in 4th year

### `pwd`

- above all, currently working on 2 uni modules and an FYP
  - Distributed Optimisation and Learning
  - Human-Centred Robotics
  - Congestion Control Protocols on FPGAs project
- running society events for [IC CyberSoc](https://iccybersoc.org)
- and a lot more, that probably won't make it onto here

### rfc 1

- continue refactoring [`bt_compress`](https://github.com/lemon-gith/bt_compress) project
  - since the specified submission format was strangely improper
- rewrite the CPU from 2nd year ([`citrus_pressing_unit`](https://github.com/lemon-gith/citrus_pressing_unit))
  - by myself, incorporating ideas from my 3rd year ACA module
- write the Compiler from 2nd year ([`c2risccccc`](https://github.com/lemon-gith/c2risccccc))
  - but in Rust, and making it modular
- work on a puzzle-solver for a particular puzzle format
  - sliding block puzzles from Professor Layton and the Curious Village
- write a quiz game in Rust
  - section 2 of the Rust book, but going an extra mile or two...

### `-vvv`

Just wrote this because I like the idea of having a `README.md` for myself :)
