### whoami

A 3rd year uni student based in London, UK.

### pwd

Studied GCSEs and A-levels without a formal Computer Science education.

However, did a 5-day python bootcamp a while back and realised that coding is super fun :D

Countless small python projects were spawned, but no major projects. 

Then started attending uni, and... well... lost track of time.

### misc

Just wrote this because I like the idea of having a `README.md` for myself :)

All I'm really looking for is the time to spend on these projects, uni is really pushing it this year :/

Fun fact: pending, I'll think of a good one...
